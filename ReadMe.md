my project is just like quizlet. It takes certain terms and answers and helps you learn them

My project is using an arraylist of class card, which holds info such as the term, answer, and how hard the term is. It itterates through each to see whether the card is mastered and if not it is tested
once the deck has been mastered the user has the option to retest and shuffle the deck. The user can retest as many times as they feel nessesary even though the computer has marked it as mastered.

Mr. Kiang helped me realize that using an arraylist was the right choice for this type of project. I can now easily shuffle and itterate through the deck and pick and choose the info I want from a given card.
